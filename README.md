# Cura-packaging

## Home of the packaging files for:
* https://launchpad.net/~thopiekar/+archive/ubuntu/cura
* https://launchpad.net/~thopiekar/+archive/ubuntu/cura-master

## Any problems with your installation?
Take a look at [Troubleshooting](Troubleshooting.md) first. If you are sure that your problems are 100%ly related to the packages and not to Cura itself, report your problems here. When reporting problems at [Cura](https://github.com/Ultimaker/Cura), do not forget to mention me in your issue report by `@thopiekar`, so I get notified.
There is also a issue report for different problems at [#1094](https://github.com/Ultimaker/Cura/issues/1094). Users already exchange their workarounds there and also help each other.
